## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [JQuery](https://api.jquery.com/) - JS library

### What I learned

### Continued development

There are lot of JQuery Methods out there... This is not to be left out, Learning more about the whole library itself and making use of it properly when needed would be very tasking.


### Useful resources

- [Jquery Remove Class](https://api.jquery.com/removeclass/) - This helped me for removing the class of the previous selected trigger. Using Jquery made it easier for me to get the element and remove the class instanteously. I'd recommend using this method to anyone still learning about Jquery.
